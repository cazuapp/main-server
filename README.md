### What is CazuApp?

**CazuApp** is an innovative, open-source delivery application designed to streamline and optimize the process of goods delivery.

- [Main App](https://github.com/cazuapp/main-app) - The core application for users.
- [Driver App](https://github.com/cazuapp/driver-app) - Dedicated app for drivers.
- [Admin App](https://github.com/cazuapp/admin-app) - Administrative and monitoring tools for managers.
